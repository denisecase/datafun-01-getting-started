Functions

Functions are reusable bits of code.
Functions are defined using the def keyword.
Functions are called using the function name and parentheses.
Functions can accept parameters (arguments).
Functions can return values.

Built-in Functions

Python has many helpful built-in functions.

len() is a built-in function that returns the length of an object.
min() is a built-in function that returns the smallest item in an iterable.
max() is a built-in function that returns the largest item in an iterable.  

print() is a built-in function that prints to the screen.
input() is a built-in function that gets input from the user.

str() is a built-in function that converts a value to a string.
int() is a built-in function that converts a value to an integer.
