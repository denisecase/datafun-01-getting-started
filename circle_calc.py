"""
This script calculates the area of a circle.

It illustrates importing modules and using constants.

It also illustrates using the built-in function round().

When you install Python, you get a bunch of modules.
These modules are called the standard library.
Nearly all scripts will import at least one module 
from the standard library.

If the standard library doesn't have what you need, 
you can install third-party modules.

We'll do that later. 

All the programs in this repo use only the standard library.
