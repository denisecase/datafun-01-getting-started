Statements

All Python programs are composed of statements.
Statements are instructions that tell the computer to do something.
Each statement is written on a separate line.

Variables

Variables are used to store values.
Variables are created when they are first assigned a value.
Variables are used to refer to values later in the program.
Variables can be reassigned to refer to a different value.

Comments

Comments are used to document code.
Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter.
Comments are preceded by the # symbol.
Comments can be placed on their own line or at the end of a line.
Comments can be used to disable code.

Opening Remarks

These introductory remarks are comments. 
By wrapping a comment in triple quotes, we can make multi-line comments.
