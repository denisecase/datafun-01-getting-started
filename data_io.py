"""
Purpose: Illustrate how to write data to a file, read data from a file, 
process the data, and write processed information to a new file. 

Illustrates pathlib and the joinpath function for safe cross-platform file path creation.

This module name is: dataio

IO = input / output

CSV files are comma-separated values files.
They are text files and very common in data analytics.
CSV files are easy to read and write in Python.

csv.writer writes all data as a string.
csv.reader reads add data as a string.

Later, we'll use more powerful external libraries to read and write files, e.g.:
- pylightxl to read and write Excel files
- pandas to read and write csv, Excel, yaml, json, and more

@ uses csv module to read and write csv files
@ uses pathlib module to create and access a relative folders
